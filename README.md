Python has easy to learn structure, it runs on multiple OS and it has vast number of tools and libraries.

# This repository includes basics of Python: 
- an overview of the installation process, basic Python syntax, and an example of how to construct and run a simple Python program. 
- work with dates and times, read and write files, and retrieve and parse HTML, JSON, and XML data from the web.

# Set up Python Environment:
**How to determine Python is installed on your system?**

- Open terminal/command prompt on your computer.
- Go into your exercise files directory.
- Use python command to run the python file and hit **Enter**.
